    The SimulatedAnnealing class that changes a random node in the model to a random valid value.
    Each improvement or equivalent solution is kept for the next iteration.
    Also sometimes accepts solutions that are worse, depending on the current temperature.
    Most of the functions are similar to those of the HillClimber class, which is why
    we use that as a parent class.
